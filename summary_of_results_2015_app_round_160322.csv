Disease and Trait Mapping Genetics),genomics,genetic risk factors,genetic analysis,neurogenetics,psychiatric disorders,"Social media, weather forecasting and mineral exploration are driven by Big Data enabled by new technologies. Likewise, disease prevention, diagnosis and prediction is moving towards personalised and precision medicine, facilitated by novel genomics technologies. This Program of research will develop analysis methods and tools and apply them to clinical genomics data in neurological and psychiatric disorders, thereby paving the way for the translation of genomic tools to common diseases.",.

The result is much harm and unsustainable overuse. We will research the prevalence, causes and consequences of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, evaluate solutions and widely disseminate findings.",.

Despite improvements in prevention, detection and treatment, it is the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. Research advances in the last decade have improved our understanding of the pathways from susceptibility to progression and metastasis but this has mostly not yet translated into better outcomes. This program aims to translate some of our fundamental discoveries to improve outcome for affected women and their families.",.

Sleep quality, balance, mood, cardiovascular health will be measured.",.
